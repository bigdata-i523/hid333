        Smart Security systems equipped with Video and Audio sensors
        produce huge amounts of unstructured data continuously. This
        paper talks about highlevel architecture of an intelligent
        security system with video surveillance, audio
        monitoring/recording, video and Audio analytics, alerting
        homeowners/authorities/agencies as needed.

        Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Analyze Human Speech Data
    abstract: >
        Automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language
        processing (NLP) based intelligent system can be used in
        several human machine interface applications both in consumer
        and industrial sector. This paper describes the architecture,
        building blocks, performance and applications for such system
        that would use pre-developed ASR and NLP APIs.
